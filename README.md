# minesweeper for arch

The classic minesweeper game made for Arch Linux using the SFML library.
I'm planning on making this a repo similar to the repos in the AUR, with a PKGBUILD and all that.

### build

It's built using the **make** utility, so clone the repo, `cd` into the **sources** folder, then build it using `make` and run it using `make run` (or just `cd` into the newly created **bin** folder at the root of the project and run the executable directly).
